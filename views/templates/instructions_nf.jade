            p Please read them carefully.
            p This game consists of ten rounds of decisions.
            p Each round you will make two choices. With each choice you allocate a number of coins to your private account and another number of coins to your partner.
            p Here is how such a choice works: you make an allocation decision on a slider (see below) â€“ whatever allocation you choose, you will receive the number at the top and your partner will receive the number at the bottom.

                            td(style='font-weight:normal;') You receive:
                            each val, index in receive1
                                td(style='text-align:center;height:33px;width:30px;background:#fff;-webkit-border-radius: 5px 5px 0px 0px;-moz-border-radius: 5px 5px 0px 0px;border-radius: 5px 5px 0px 0px;', class='firstHoverclass' + index)= val
                        tr
                            td(style='border-top:1px solid black;border-bottom:1px solid black;')
                            - var i = 0;
                            while i < 9
                                td(style='height:33px;border-top:1px solid black;border-bottom:1px solid black;text-align:center;background:#fff;', class='firstHoverclass' + i)
                                    input(type='radio', name='position', id='firstPos' + i, value=i++, disabled='disabled')
                        tr
                            td(style='font-weight:normal;') Your partner receives:
                            each val, index in send1
                                td(style='height:33px;text-align:center;background:#fff;-webkit-border-radius: 0px 0px 5px 5px;-moz-border-radius: 0px 0px 5px 5px;border-radius: 0px 0px 5px 5px;', class='firstHoverclass' + index)= val
                    
            
            p At the same time your recipient is faced with the same decision as you and you will receive the number of coins that he/she allocates to you.
            p At the end of the ten rounds, you will receive the total number of coins that you allocated to yourself plus the total number of coins that your partner allocated to you. The exchange rate is such that 4,000 coins are worth 1 USD.
