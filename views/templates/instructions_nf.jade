            p Please read these instructions carefully.
            p This game consists of ten rounds of play. Your decisions will affect your own payoff and that of another person, who remains your partner for the entire game.
            p Each round, you will make a choice to allocate a number of coins to your private account and another number of coins to your recipient.
            p Here is how such a choice works: you make an allocation decision on a slider (see below) â€“ whatever allocation you choose, you will receive the number at the top and your recipient will receive the number at the bottom.

            p At the end of the ten rounds, you will receive the total number of coins that you allocated to yourself plus the total number of coins that were allocated to you. The exchange rate is such that 2,000 coins are worth 1 USD.
